- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cybersectv
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Infrastructure as code, Networking, Cyber Security and Project ops. 
As a secondary, I'm developing an understanding of the Log4j event and how that affects [everything] for the next couple of years

Current skills

Citrix Cloud, PowerShell, Hyper-V and VMware, Testing Infrastructure and some basic knowledge on Finance Apps

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving into Cyber Security, coupling this with Infrastructure: setting up my own Test labs via PowerShell to automate routine Windows Tasks.
